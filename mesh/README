Compilation and installation
============================

In addition to main BlueZ requirements, MeshCtl needs the following:
	- json-c library

Configuration and options
=========================

	--enable-mesh

		Build mesh daemon and other Bluetooth Mesh based tools

Current implementation of the mesh daemon requires exclusive access to
a Bluetooth controller.
The AutoEnable option in the installed main.conf should be set to "false".

Storage
=======

Default storage directory is /var/lib/bluetooth/mesh.

The directory contains the provisioned nodes configurations.
Each node has its own subdirectory, named with a 4-digit (hexadecimal)
identificator that is internally generated by the mesh daemon at the time
of the node provisioning.

Each subdirectory contains the following files:
	- node.json:
		node configuration and is populated by the
		daemon based on the configuration commands from a
		provisioner/configuration client
	- node.json.bak:
		a backup that the last known good node configuration.

The files are in JSON format.
