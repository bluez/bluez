Client hierarchy
================

Service		org.bluez.obex.client
Interface	org.bluez.obex.Client
Object path	/

Methods		object CreateSession(string destination, dict args)

			Create a new OBEX session for the given remote address.

			The last parameter is a dictionary to hold optional or
			type-specific parameters. Typical parameters that can
			be set in this dictionary include the following:

				string "Target" : type of session to be created
				string "Source" : local address to be used
				byte "Channel"

			The currently supported targets are the following:

				"FTP"
				"MAP"
				"OPP"
				"PBAP"
				"SYNC"

		void RemoveSession(object session)

			Unregister session and abort pending transfers.

Session hierarchy
=================

Interface	org.bluez.obex.ObjectPush
Object path	[variable prefix]/{session0,session1,...}

Methods		object, dict SendFile(string sourcefile)

			Send one local file to the remote device.

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.

			The properties of this transfer are also returned along
			with the object path, to avoid a call to GetProperties.

		object, dict PullBusinessCard(string targetfile)

			Request the business card from a remote device and
			store it in the local file.

			If an empty target file is given, a name will be
			automatically calculated for the temporary file.

							string targetfile)

			Push the client's business card to the remote device
			and then retrieve the remote business card and store
			it in a local file.

			If an empty target file is given, a name will be
			automatically calculated for the temporary file.

			The returned path represents the newly created transfer,
			which should be used to find out if the content has been
			successfully transferred or if the operation fails.
