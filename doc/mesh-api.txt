Mesh Network Hierarchy
======================
Service		org.bluez.mesh
Interface	org.bluez.mesh.Network1
Object path	/org/bluez/mesh

Methods:
		void Join(object app_defined_root, array{byte}[16] uuid)

			This is the first method that an application has to call to become
			a provisioned node on a mesh network. The call will initiate
			broadcasting of Unprovisioned Device Beacon.

			The app_defined_root parameter is a D-Bus object root path of the
			application that implements org.bluez.mesh.Application1 interface.
			The application represents a node where child mesh elements have
			their own objects that implement org.bluez.mesh.Element1 interface.
			The application hierarchy also contains a provision agent object
			that implements org.bluez.mesh.ProvisionAgent1 interface.
			The standard DBus.ObjectManager interface must be available on the
			app_defined_root path.

			The uuid parameter is a 16-byte array that contains Device UUID.

			PossibleErrors:
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments

		void Cancel(void)
			Cancels an outstanding provisioning request initiated by Join()
			method.

		(object node, array{byte, array{(uint16, dict}} configuration)
				Attach(object app_defined_root, uint64 token)

			This is the first method that an application must call to get access
			to mesh node functionalities.

			The app_defined_root parameter is a D-Bus object root path of the
			application that implements org.bluez.mesh.Application1 interface.
			The application represents a node where child mesh elements have
			their own objects that implement org.bluez.mesh.Element1 interface.
			The standard DBus.ObjectManager interface must be available on the
			app_defined_root path.

			The token parameter is a 64-bit number that has been assigned to the
			application when it first got provisioned/joined mesh network, i.e.
			upon receiving JoinComplete() method. The daemon uses the token to
			verify whether the application is authorized to assume the mesh
			node identity.

			In case of success, the method call returns mesh node object (see
			Mesh Node Hierarchy section) and current configuration settings.
			The return value of configuration parameter is an array, where each
			entry is a structure that contains element configuration.
			The element configuration structure is organized as follows:

				byte

					Element index, identifies the element to which this
					configuration entry pertians.

				array{struct}

					Models array where each entry is a structure with the
					following members:

						uint16

							Either a SIG Model Identifier or, if Vendor key is
							present in model configuration dictionary, a 16-bit
							vendor-assigned Model Identifier

						dict

							A dictionary that contains model configuration with
							the following keys defined:

								array{uint16} Bindings

									Indices of application keys bound to
									the model

								uint32 PublicationPeriod

									Model publication period in milliseconds

								uint16 Vendor

									A 16-bit Bluetooth-assigned Company
									Identifier of the vendor as defined by
									Bluetooth SIG

			PossibleErrors:
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound,
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.Failed

		void Leave(uint64 token)

			This removes the configuration information about the mesh node
			identified by the 64-bit token parameter. The token parameter
			has been obtained as a result of successful Join() method call.

			PossibleErrors:
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound


Mesh Node Hierarchy
===================
Service		org.bluez.mesh
Interface	org.bluez.mesh.Node1
Object path	/org/bluez/mesh/node<xxxx>
		where xxxx is a 4-digit hexadecimal number generated by meshd daemon

Methods:
		void Send(object element_path, uint16 destination, uint16 key_index,
								array{byte} data)

			This method is used to send a message originated by a local model.

			The element_path parameter is the object path of an element from
			a collection of the application elements (see Mesh Application
			Hierarchy section).

			The destination parameter contains the destination address. This
			destination must be a uint16 to a unicast address, or a well known
			group address.

			The key_index parameter determines which application key to use for
			encrypting the message. The key_index must be valid for that
			element, i.e., the application key must be bound to a model on this
			element. Otherwise, org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotAuthorized will be
			returned.

			The data parameter is an outgoing message to be encypted by the
			meshd daemon and sent on.

			Possible errors:
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotAuthorized
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.NotFound

		void Publish(object element_path, uint16 model, array{byte} data)

			This method is used to send a publication originated by a local
			model. If the model does not exist, or it has no publication record,
			the method returns org.bluez.mesh.Error.DoesNotExist error.

			The element_path parameter is the object path of an element from
			a collection of the application elements (see Mesh Application
			Hierarchy section).

			The model parameter contains a model ID, as defined by the
			Bluetooth SIG.

			Since only one Publish record may exist per element-model, the
			destination and key_index are obtained from the Publication
			record cached by the daemon.

			Possible errors:
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.DoesNotExist
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments

		void VendorPublish(object element_path, uint16 vendor, uint16 model_id,
								array{byte} data)

			This method is used to send a publication originated by a local
			vendor model. If the model does not exist, or it has no publication
			record, the method returns org.bluez.mesh.Error.DoesNotExist error.

			The element_path parameter is the object path of an element from
			a collection of the application elements (see Mesh Application
			Hierarchy section).

			The vendor parameter is a 16-bit Bluetooth-assigned Company
			Identifier.

			The model_id parameter is a 16-bit vendor-assigned Model Identifier.

			Since only one Publish record may exist per element-model, the
			destination and key_index are obtained from the Publication
			record cached by the daemon.

			Possible errors:
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.DoesNotExist
				org.bluez.mesh.Error.InvalidArguments

Properties:
		dict Features [read-only]

			The dictionary that contains information about feature support.
			The following keys are defined:

					Indicates the ability to establish a friendship with a
					Low Power node

				boolean LowPower

					Indicates support for operating in Low Power node mode

				boolean Proxy

					Indicates support for GATT proxy

				boolean Relay - indicates support for relaying messages

			If the key is absent from the dictionary, the feature is not
			supported. Otherwise, true means that the feature is enabled and
			false means that the feature is disabled.

		boolean Beacon [read-only]

			This property indicates whether the periodic beaconing is enabled
			(true) or disabled (false).

		uint32 SecondsSinceLastHeard [read-only]

			This property may be read at any time to determine the number of
			seconds since mesh network layer traffic was last detected on this
			node's network.


Mesh Application Hierarchy
==========================
Service		unique name
Interface		org.bluez.mesh.Application1
Object path	<app_defined_root>

An application is a collection of elements that host SIG defined and vendor
specific models. It is expected that an application implements
org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager interface.

An example mesh application hierarchy may look like this:

		-> /com/example
			|   - org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager
			|   - org.bluez.mesh.Application1
			|   - org.bluez.mesh.Attention1 (optional)

			| |   - org.bluez.mesh.Element1

Methods:
		void JoinComplete(uint64 token)

			This method is called when the node provisioning initiated
			by a Join() method call successfully completed.

			The token parameter serves as a unique identifier of the particular
			node. The token must be preserved by the application in order to
			authenticate itself to the mesh daemon and attach to the network
			as a mesh node by calling Attach() method or permanently remove the
			identity of the mesh node by calling Leave() method.

		void JoinFailed(string reason)

			This method is called when the node provisioning initiated
			by Join() has failed.

			The reason parameter identifies the reason for provisioning failure.
			The defined values are: "timeout", "bad-pdu", "confirmation-failed",

Provisioning Agent Hierarchy
============================
Service		unique name
Interface	org.bluez.mesh.ProvisionAgent1
Object path	freely definable

Methods:
		array{byte} PrivateKey()

			This method is called during provisioning if the Provisioner
			has requested Out-Of-Band ECC key exchange. The Private key
			is returned to the Daemon, and the Public Key is delivered to
			the remote Provisioner using a method that does not involve
			the Bluetooth Mesh system. The Private Key returned must be
			32 octets in size, or the Provisioning procedure will fail
			and be canceled.

			This function will only be called if the Provisioner has
			requested pre-determined keys to be exchanged Out-of-Band,
			and the local role is Unprovisioned device.

		array{byte} PublicKey()

			This method is called during provisioning if the local device
			is the Provisioner, and is requestng Out-Of-Band ECC key
			exchange. The Public key is returned to the Daemon
			that is the matched pair of the Private key of the remote
			device. The Public Key returned must be 64 octets in
			size, or the Provisioning procedure will fail and be canceled.

			This function will only be called if the Provisioner has
			requested pre-determined keys to be exchanged Out-of-Band,
			and the local role is Provisioner.

		void DisplayString(string display)
			This method is called when the Daemon has something important
			for the Agent to Display, but does not require any additional
			input locally. For instance: "Enter "ABCDE" on remote device".

		void DisplayNumeric(uint8 type, uint32 number)

			This method is called when the Daemon has something important
			for the Agent to Display, but does not require any additional
			input locally. For instance: "Enter 149264 on remote device".

			The type parameter indicates the display method. An enumeration
			of "Blink", "Beep", "Vibrate", or "OutNumeric".

			The number parameter is the specific value represented by
			the Prompt.

		uint32 PromptNumeric(uint8 type)

			This method is called when the Daemon has requires the user to
			enter a 1-9 digit decimal value.

			The type parameter indicates the input method. An enumeration
			of "Push", "Twist", or "InNumeric".

			This agent should prompt the user for specific input. For instance:
			"Enter value being displayed by remote device".

		array{byte} PromptStatic(uint8 type)

			This method is called when the Daemon requires a 16 octet
			byte array, as an Out-of-Band authentication.

			The type parameter indicates the input method. An enumeration
			of "Static", or "InAlpha".

			The Static data returned must be 16 octets in size, or the
			Provisioning procedure will fail and be canceled. If input is
			an InAlpha String, the printable charactors should be left
			justified, with trailing 0x00 octets filling the remaining bytes.

		void Cancel()

			This method gets called by the daemon to cancel any existing
			Agent Requests. When called, any pending user input should be
			canceled.
