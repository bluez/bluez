	The commands Read Management Version Information and Read
	management Supported Commands are not included in this list.
	Both commands are always supported and mandatory.

	The events Command Status and Command Complete are not included
	in this list. Both are implicit and mandatory.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Read Controller Index List Command
==================================

	Command Code:		0x0003
	Controller Index:	<non-controller>
	Command Parameters:
	Return Parameters:	Num_Controllers (2 Octets)
				Controller_Index[i] (2 Octets)

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Read Controller Information Command
===================================

	Command Code:		0x0004
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:
	Return Parameters:	Address (6 Octets)
				Bluetooth_Version (1 Octet)
				Manufacturer (2 Octets)
				Supported_Settings (4 Octets)
				Current_Settings (4 Octets)
				Class_Of_Device (3 Octets)
				Name (249 Octets)
				Short_Name (11 Octets)

	If not short name is set the Short_Name parameter will be empty
	(begin with a nul byte).

	Current_Settings & Supported_Settings is a bitmask with
	currently the following available bits:

		1	Powered
		2	Connectable
		3	Fast Connectable
		4	Discoverable
		5	Pairable
		6	Link Level Security (Sec. mode 3)
		7	Secure Simple Pairing
		8	Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Powered Command
===================

	Command Code:		0x0005
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Powered (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	If discoverable setting is activated with a timeout, then
	switching the controller off will expire this timeout and
	disable discoverable.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Discoverable Command
========================

	Command Code:		0x0006
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Discoverable (1 Octet)
				Timeout (2 Octets)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	Timeout is the time in seconds and is only meaningful when
	Discoverable is set to 1.

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	However using a timeout when the controller is not powered will
	return an error.

	When switching discoverable on and the connectable setting is
	off it will return an error.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Connectable Command
=======================

	Command Code:		0x0007
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Connectable (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	When switching connectable off, it will also switch off the
	discoverable setting. Switching connectable back on will not
	restore a previous discoverable. It will stay off and needs
	to be manually switched back on.

	When switching connectable off, it will expire a discoverable
	setting with a timeout.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Fast Connectable Command
============================

	Command Code:		0x0008
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Enable (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	If connectable is not set, then this command will fail.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Pairable Command
====================

	Command Code:		0x0009
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Pairable (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	Turning pairable on will not automatically switch the controller
	into connectable mode. That needs to be done separately.

	The setting will be remembered during power down/up toggles.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Link Security Command
=========================

	Command Code:		0x000A
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Link_Security (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	Command Code:		0x000B
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Secure_Simple_Pairing (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	In case the controller does not support Secure Simple Pairing,
	the command will fail regardless.

	Command Code:		0x000D
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Low_Energy (1 Octet)
	Return Parameters:	Current_Settings (4 Octets)

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	In case the kernel subsystem does not support Low Energy or the
	controller does not either, the command will fail regardless.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Device Class
================

	Command Code:		0x000E
	Controller Index:	<controller id>

	This command will also implicitly disable caching of pending CoD
	and EIR updates.

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	In case the controller is powered off, 0x000000 will be returned
	for the class of device parameter. And after power on the new
	value will be announced via class of device changed event.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.


Set Local Name Command
======================

	Command Code:		0x000F
	Controller Index:	<controller id>
	Command Parameters:	Name (249 Octets)
				Short_Name (11 Octets)
	Return Parameters:	Name (249 Octets)
				Short_Name (11 Octets)

	The name parameters need to always end with a nul byte (failure
	to do so will cause the command to fail).

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	The values of name and short name will be remembered when
	switching the controller off and back on again. So the name
	and short name only have to be set once when a new controller
	is found and will stay until removed.

	This command generates a Command Complete event on success or
	a Command Status event on failure.

	previously loaded UUIDs will be removed.

	This command can be used when the controller is not powered and
	all settings will be programmed once powered.

	In case the controller is powered off, 0x000000 will be returned
	for the class of device parameter. And after power on the new
	value will be announced via class of device changed event.
