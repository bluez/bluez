Methods
-------

void Answer()
`````````````

	Answers an incoming call. Only valid if the state of the call is
	"incoming".

	Possible Errors:
	:org.bluez.Error.InvalidState
	:org.bluez.Error.Failed

void Hangup()
`````````````

	Hangs up the call.

	For an incoming call, the call is hung up using ATH or equivalent. For
	a waiting call, the remote party is notified by using the User
	Determined User Busy (UDUB) condition. This is generally implemented
	using CHLD=0.

	Please note that the GSM specification does not allow the release of a
	held call when a waiting call exists. This is because 27.007 allows
	CHLD=1X to operate only on active calls. Hence a held call cannot be
	hung up without affecting the state of the incoming call (e.g. using
	other CHLD alternatives). Most manufacturers provide vendor extensions
	that do allow the state of the held call to be modified using CHLD=1X
	or equivalent. It should be noted that Bluetooth HFP specifies the
	classic 27.007 behavior and does not allow CHLD=1X to modify the state
	of held calls.

	Based on the discussion above, it should also be noted that releasing a
	particular party of a held multiparty call might not be possible on
	some implementations. It is recommended for the applications to
	structure their UI accordingly.

	NOTE: Releasing active calls does not produce side-effects. That is the
	state of held or waiting calls is not affected. As an exception, in the
	case where a single active call and a waiting call are present,
	releasing the active call will result in the waiting call transitioning
	to the 'incoming' state.

	Possible Errors:
	:org.bluez.Error.InvalidState
	:org.bluez.Error.Failed

Properties
----------

string LineIdentification [readonly]
````````````````````````````````````

	Contains the Line Identification information returned by the network,
	if present. For incoming calls this is effectively the CLIP. For
	outgoing calls this attribute will hold the dialed number, or the COLP
	if received by the audio gateway.

	Please note that COLP may be different from the dialed number. A
	special "withheld" value means the remote party refused to provide
	caller ID and the "override category" option was not provisioned for
	the current subscriber.

string IncomingLine [readonly, optional]
````````````````````````````````````````

	Contains the Called Line Identification information returned by the
	network.
	This is only available for incoming calls and indicates the local
	subscriber number which was dialed by the remote party. This is useful
	for subscribers which have a multiple line service with their network
	provider and would like to know what line the call is coming in on.

string Name [readonly]
``````````````````````

	Contains the Name Identification information returned by the network,
	if present.

boolean Multiparty [readonly]
`````````````````````````````

	Contains the indication if the call is part of a multiparty call or
	not.

	Notifications if a call becomes part or leaves a multiparty call are
	sent.

string State [readonly]
```````````````````````

	Contains the state of the current call.

		Possible values:

	:"active":

		The call is active

	:"held":

		The call is on hold

	:"dialing":

		The call is being dialed

	:"alerting":

		The remote party is being alerted

	:"incoming":

		Incoming call in progress

	:"waiting":

		Call is waiting

		No further use of this object is allowed, it will be
		destroyed shortly
