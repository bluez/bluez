BlueZ D-Bus Advertisement Monitor API Description
*************************************************

This API allows an client to specify a job of monitoring advertisements by
registering the root of hierarchy and then exposing advertisement monitors
under the root with filtering conditions, thresholds of RSSI and timers
of RSSI thresholds.

Once a monitoring job is activated by BlueZ, the client can expect to get
notified on the targeted advertisements no matter if there is an ongoing
discovery session (a discovery session is started/stopped with methods in
org.bluez.Adapter1 interface).

Advertisement Monitor hierarchy
===============================
Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1 [experimental]
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release() [noreply]

			This gets called as a signal for a client to perform
			clean-up when (1)a monitor cannot be activated after it
			was exposed or (2)a monitor has been deactivated.

		void Activate() [noreply]

			After a monitor was exposed, this gets called as a
			signal for client to get acknowledged when a monitor
			has been activated, so the client can expect to receive
			calls on DeviceFound() or DeviceLost().

		void DeviceFound(object device) [noreply]

			This gets called to notify the client of finding the
			targeted device. Once receiving the call, the client
			should start to monitor the corresponding device to
			retrieve the changes on RSSI and advertisement content.

		void DeviceLost(object device) [noreply]

			This gets called to notify the client of losing the
			targeted device. Once receiving this call, the client
			should stop monitoring the corresponding device.

Properties	string Type [read-only]

			The type of the monitor. See SupportedMonitorTypes in
			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1 for the available
			options.

		(Int16, Uint16, Int16, Uint16) RSSIThresholdsAndTimers [read-only, optional]

			This contains HighRSSIThreshold, HighRSSIThresholdTimer,
			LowRSSIThreshold, LowRSSIThresholdTimer in order. The
			unit of HighRSSIThreshold and LowRSSIThreshold is dBm.
			The unit of HighRSSIThresholdTimer and
			LowRSSIThresholdTimer is second.

			If these are provided, RSSI would be used as a factor to
			notify the client of whether a device stays in range or
			move out of range. A device is considered in-range when
			the RSSIs of the received advertisement(s) during
			HighRSSIThresholdTimer seconds exceed HighRSSIThreshold.
			Likewise, a device is considered out-of-range when the
			RSSIs of the received advertisement(s) during
			LowRSSIThresholdTimer do not reach LowRSSIThreshold.

			The valid range of a RSSI is -127 to +20 dBm while 127
			dBm indicates unset. The valid range of a timer is 1 to
			300 seconds while 0 indicates unset.

			If the peer device advertising interval is greater than the
			HighRSSIThresholdTimer, the device will never be found. Similarly,
			if it is greater than LowRSSIThresholdTimer, the device will be
			considered as lost. Consider configuring these values accordingly.

		array{(uint8, uint8, array{byte})} Patterns [read-only, optional]

			If Type is set to 0x01, this must exist and has at least
			one entry in the array.

			The structure of a pattern contains the following.
			uint8 start_position
				The index in an AD data field where the search
				should start. The beginning of an AD data field
				is index 0.
			uint8 AD_data_type
				See https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/
				assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile/ for
				the possible allowed value.
			array{byte} content_of_pattern
				This is the value of the pattern. The maximum
				length of the bytes is 31.

Advertisement Monitor Manager hierarchy
=======================================
Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1 [experimental]
Object path	/org/bluez/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		void RegisterMonitor(object application)

			This registers the root path of a hierarchy of
			advertisement monitors.
			The application object path together with the D-Bus
			system bus connection ID define the identification of
			the application registering advertisement monitors.
			Once a root path is registered by a client via this
			method, the client can freely expose/unexpose
			advertisement monitors without re-registering the root
			path again. After use, the client should call
			UnregisterMonitor() method to invalidate the
			advertisement monitors.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void UnregisterMonitor(object application)

			This unregisters a hierarchy of advertisement monitors
			that has been previously registered. The object path
			parameter must match the same value that has been used
			on registration. Upon unregistration, the advertisement
			monitor(s) should expect to receive Release() method as
			the signal that the advertisement monitor(s) has been
			deactivated.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist

Properties	array{string} SupportedMonitorTypes [read-only]

			This lists the supported types of advertisement
			monitors. An application should check this before
			instantiate and expose an object of
			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1.

			Possible values for monitor types:

			"or_patterns"
				Patterns with logic OR applied. With this type,
				property "Patterns" must exist and has at least
				one pattern.

		array{string} SupportedFeatures [read-only]

			This lists the features of advertisement monitoring
			supported by BlueZ.

			Possible values for features:

			"controller-patterns"
				If the controller is capable of performing
				advertisement monitoring by patterns, BlueZ
				would offload the patterns to the controller to
				reduce power consumption.
