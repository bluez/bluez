BlueZ D-Bus Advertisement Monitor API Description
*************************************************

This API allows an client to specify a job of monitoring advertisements by
registering the root of hierarchy and then exposing advertisement monitors
under the root with filtering conditions, thresholds of RSSI and timers
of RSSI thresholds.

Once a monitoring job is activated by BlueZ, the client can expect to get
notified on the targeted advertisements no matter if there is an ongoing
discovery session (a discovery session is started/stopped with methods in
org.bluez.Adapter1 interface).

Advertisement Monitor hierarchy
===============================
Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1 [experimental]
Object path	freely definable

Methods		void Release() [noreply]

			This gets called as a signal for a client to perform
			clean-up when (1)a monitor cannot be activated after it
			was exposed or (2)a monitor has been deactivated.

		void Activate() [noreply]

			After a monitor was exposed, this gets called as a
			signal for client to get acknowledged when a monitor
			has been activated, so the client can expect to receive
			calls on DeviceFound() or DeviceLost().

		void DeviceFound(object device) [noreply]

			This gets called to notify the client of finding the
			targeted device. Once receiving the call, the client
			should start to monitor the corresponding device to
			retrieve the changes on RSSI and advertisement content.

		void DeviceLost(object device) [noreply]

			This gets called to notify the client of losing the
			targeted device. Once receiving this call, the client
			should stop monitoring the corresponding device.

Properties	string Type [read-only]

			The type of the monitor. See SupportedMonitorTypes in
			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1 for the available
			options.

		Int16 RSSILowThreshold [read-only, optional]

			Used in conjunction with RSSILowTimeout to determine
			whether a device becomes out-of-range. Valid range is
			-127 to 20 (dBm), while 127 indicates unset.

		Int16 RSSIHighThreshold [read-only, optional]

			Used in conjunction with RSSIHighTimeout to determine
			whether a device becomes in-range. Valid range is
			-127 to 20 (dBm), while 127 indicates unset.

		Uint16 RSSILowTimeout [read-only, optional]

			The time it takes to consider a device as out-of-range.
			If this many seconds elapses without receiving any
			signal at least as strong as RSSILowThreshold, a
			currently in-range device will be considered as
			out-of-range (lost). Valid range is 1 to 300 (seconds),
			while 0 indicates unset.

		Uint16 RSSIHighTimeout [read-only, optional]

			The time it takes to consider a device as in-range.
			If this many seconds elapses while we continuously
			receive signals at least as strong as RSSIHighThreshold,
			a currently out-of-range device will be considered as
			in-range (found). Valid range is 1 to 300 (seconds),
			while 0 indicates unset.

		Uint16 RSSISamplingPeriod [read-only, optional]

			Grouping rules on how to propagate the received
			advertisement packets to the client. Valid range is 0 to
			255 while 256 indicates unset.

			The meaning of this property is as follows:
			0:
				All advertisement packets from in-range devices
				would be propagated.
			255:
				Only the first advertisement packet of in-range
				devices would be propagated. If the device
				becomes lost, then the first packet when it is
				found again will also be propagated.
			1 to 254:
				Advertisement packets would be grouped into
				100ms * N time period. Packets in the same group
				will only be reported once, with the RSSI value
				being averaged out.

			Currently this is unimplemented in user space, so the
			value is only used to be forwarded to the kernel.

		array{(uint8, uint8, array{byte})} Patterns [read-only, optional]

			If Type is set to 0x01, this must exist and has at least
			one entry in the array.

			The structure of a pattern contains the following.
			uint8 start_position
				The index in an AD data field where the search
				should start. The beginning of an AD data field
				is index 0.
			uint8 AD_data_type
				See https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/
				assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile/ for
				the possible allowed value.
			array{byte} content_of_pattern
				This is the value of the pattern. The maximum
				length of the bytes is 31.

Advertisement Monitor Manager hierarchy
=======================================
Service		org.bluez
Interface	org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitorManager1 [experimental]
Object path	/org/bluez/{hci0,hci1,...}

Methods		void RegisterMonitor(object application)

			This registers the root path of a hierarchy of
			advertisement monitors.
			The application object path together with the D-Bus
			system bus connection ID define the identification of
			the application registering advertisement monitors.
			Once a root path is registered by a client via this
			method, the client can freely expose/unexpose
			advertisement monitors without re-registering the root
			path again. After use, the client should call
			UnregisterMonitor() method to invalidate the
			advertisement monitors.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists
					 org.bluez.Error.Failed

		void UnregisterMonitor(object application)

			This unregisters a hierarchy of advertisement monitors
			that has been previously registered. The object path
			parameter must match the same value that has been used
			on registration. Upon unregistration, the advertisement
			monitor(s) should expect to receive Release() method as
			the signal that the advertisement monitor(s) has been
			deactivated.

			Possible errors: org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments
					 org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist

Properties	array{string} SupportedMonitorTypes [read-only]

			This lists the supported types of advertisement
			monitors. An application should check this before
			instantiate and expose an object of
			org.bluez.AdvertisementMonitor1.

			Possible values for monitor types:

			"or_patterns"
				Patterns with logic OR applied. With this type,
				property "Patterns" must exist and has at least
				one pattern.

		array{string} SupportedFeatures [read-only]

			This lists the features of advertisement monitoring
			supported by BlueZ.

			Possible values for features:

			"controller-patterns"
				If the controller is capable of performing
				advertisement monitoring by patterns, BlueZ
				would offload the patterns to the controller to
				reduce power consumption.
